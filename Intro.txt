Hello Github

I am Yuktha Sri Vennela

I am a second year undergraduate student at Sagi Ramakrishnam Raju Engineering College.

I love to explore things and am a competitive programmer(beginner-level). 

I contribute as a Campus lead for a community called "Code for Cause" where the primary focus is to provide guidance and mentorship to students!

My unending passion for learning and a strong desire to make a difference in my community strives me to be better!

Thank you :)
